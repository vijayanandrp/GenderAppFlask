# GenderAppFlask

Web application
![alt text](https://github.com/vijayanandrp/GenderAppFlask/blob/master/Restapi.JPG "Name Classifier")

Combined NaiveBayesClassifier Gender Classification Python program with REST API (flask-restful after stuck with Django).

Just for my own practice. 

Though I am not good at web but tried my best.
